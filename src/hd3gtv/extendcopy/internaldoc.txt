List, copy and verify files while keeping control.

Usage
  java -jar extendcopy.jar ACTION -from SOURCE -to DESTINATION OPTIONS PROJECT

ACTION: l or list / c or copy / v or verify / lc / cv / lcv
SOURCE: the folder from which to go files.
DESTINATION: the folder where your files go.

OPTIONS : An optional one
 -exclude -nohidden -keep OR -force -makehashtag -dryrun -notesthash

PROJECT : The base name text files of lists.
 Allows the return to work in case of manual stop.

You can use -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx=512m to allow the Java VM
 to use up to 512 MB of RAM (if you have very long lists).

By default, the hash/digest is computed from in MD5.
 You can change this value with the option -Dextendcopy.hashname=XXXX

Dates and file permissions are not reflected on copies.
Symlinks, special files (blocs. ..), Icon? files (OSX folder icons)
are systematically ignored.
The program does not convert between character code names file.
Beware of "�" and other "Ã©" when you mount file systems from
multiple operating systems.
If you interrupt the application while copies / verifications, the
processing resumes where it is stopped.

Options for list
 -exclude
   Rules are used to exclude files to ignore .DS_Store, desktop.ini...
 -nohidden
   It ignores hidden files (dot files on Linux / OSX or "hidden" on Windows)
Options for copy
 -keep
   If the file already exists on the destination, we do not touch it,
   even if the size is different
 -force
   If the file already exists on the destination, it will overwrite anyway,
   even if the size is identical.
   Do not use -keep et -force simultaneously
 -makehashtag
   creates a sidecar file with each copied file containing the computed hash 
 -dryrun
   does not copy, but simulated it to verify the paths of destination files   
   
Option for verify
 -notesthash
   does not test hash calculation during the verification.
   The verification did not focus more on the presence and size.
